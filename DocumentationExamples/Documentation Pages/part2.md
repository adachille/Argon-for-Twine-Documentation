To get a better understanding of Argon for Twine, letâ€™s try running an example called 'Understanding-AR', an experience dedicated to the history of augmented reality.

Follow the steps below:
1. Download and print the story images from [here](https://github.com/argonjs/understanding-argon-twine/blob/master/storybook.pdf). These are tracking images and are used to signal Argon to take some form of action.
2. Place these images face up on a flat surface.
3. Open the Argon4 application on your phone.
4. Navigate to [this page]( http://philkt.me/understanding-ar-twine/) through the Argon4 search engine.
5. With the website open, point the phone at the story image.

At this point, the 3D models and text associated with the story image should appear on the phone.

**NOTE:**
Alternatively, instead of printing the story images for step 1, you can simply point your phone at the images on your computer screen. However, the 3D models may be rotated in an unpredictable way, so it is recommended you print the images.

The source code for this example can be found in this [GitHub directory](https://github.com/argonjs/understanding-argon-twine).

Next, we will show you how to create basic AR experiences using Twine.
